These were the questions that led my search for symbols that could materialize in images and words the feelings that permeate the collective imaginary of home in its broad conception.

**HOME IS WHERE I AM** combines woodcut, letterpress handsetting, poetry and documental audio which resulted in my first big artist's book (published by the german publishing house **Edition Schwarze Seite**), an extra series of twelve woodcuts and a twenty minutes audio record obtained from the interviews conducted with refugees from Syria, Nigeria, Macedonia and Pakistan.

Held at the beginning of 2014, the project is the culmination of the three months as resident artist in the graphic arts studio and printshop at the Ateliers im Alten Schlachthof in the German city of Sigmaringen.
